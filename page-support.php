		<h1>Our Guaranteed Support</h1>
		<p>Gourmetoryoffers end-to-end services from product and business consulting, to design and development. We can partner with a client from the very beginning and maintain a product throughout its life. Or, we can help fill gaps in a client’s organization. We prefer to think of it this way: we’re on your team and you’re on ours. We’re most likely to make the best product decisions by working together.</p>

n					<h2>Individual Attention</h2>
					<p>On the surface, business seems like nothing more than a series of transactions. But underneath it’s relationships – relationships with vendors, employees, and most importantly, customers. Smart, innovative companies know this, and are moving to put customer relationships at the center of their business strategy.</p>

					<h2>Fast, Friendly, and Available</h2>
