	<p>As of 1996, HIPAA compliance is mandated by law. Penalties for violations are immediate and costly. Practitioners can be fined and run the risk of losing their license if found to be in repeated violation of HIPAA regulations. Given the complicated nature of the HIPAA regulations and the effort involved in maintaining HIPAA-compliant databases, health-care providers often question why it’s an absolute necessity.</p>
<h3>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</h3>
<p>Passed in 1996, the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/" target="_blank">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a> was designed to protect confidential patient health information, including all electronic medical records. The act increased security surrounding patient information, gave patients more control over the release of their confidential health information and gave health-care providers a universal set of privacy standards and penalties for violations of these regulations. In the decade since the passage of HIPAA, health-care providers have been scrambling to keep up with these privacy guidelines in an age where more and more confidential information is being stored, accessed and shared electronically. Typically, these providers have used data encryption to help secure this information and ensure compliance with HIPAA standards. Lately, a growing number are looking for additional methods for creating HIPAA-compliant databases. Although standardized penalties for lack of compliance are the primary force driving these endeavors, there are a number of other reasons why health-care providers are realizing they need a HIPAA-compliant database.</p>
<h3>Reasons for HIPAA Database Compliance</h3>
<p>The reason for HIPAA database compliance is simple and straightforward. It’s the law. HIPAA compliance is mandated for all health-care providers that handle electronic transactions of confidential patient information. That includes hospitals, general and specialized physicians, home-health organizations and service providers, and long-term-care providers. These providers are required to install, monitor and update hardware and software designed to effectively secure data while it is being stored, updated, accessed and transmitted. Companies found to be in violation put themselves at risk for expensive financial consequences. <em>Providers found to be in violation can be charged $100 to $50,000 per violation per year.</em> The exact amount depends on the severity of the violation, the number of patients involved and the severity of the provider’s negligence.</p>
<p>Tools for Securing Electronic Data</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data encryption:</strong> Protects electronic medical records during storage and transfer, and it ensures that only the intended recipient can access the files.</li>
<li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Software that prevents unauthorized access to electronic data.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic auditing systems:</strong> Requires users to sign in and logs each user’s activity on the record database.</li>
<li><strong>Professional audits:</strong> The single most reliable way to ensure current HIPAA compliance is to request a professional audit from an experienced and trainer auditor. These audits will bring to light any holes in your system and allow your health-care company to close any security gaps immediately.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Turning to the Cloud for HIPAA-Compliant Database Management</h3>
<p>Cloud-based databases have revolutionized the ease with which companies are achieving HIPAA compliance. Physical theft of records is cited as the number one cause of data-security breaches. Therefore, cloud storage solutions have been the catalyst for a significant reduction in HIPAA violations in the health-care industry.</p>
<p>Health-care providers looking to outsource the installation, migration and management of their database should consider seeking out a managed host provider who is well versed in HIPAA regulations. To learn more about using cloud-based hosting to ensure HIPAA compliance, contact a local data center to speak with a customer service representative.</p>
<h3>Understanding HIPAA-Compliant Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>Recent findings from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that using HIPAA-compliant cloud storage to house patient information is safer and more secure than either paper storage or a local server. The reason lies in the elimination of physical theft. This report cited physical theft as the number-one cause of large-scale data breaches. Using a HIPAA-compliant cloud storage system virtually eliminates this risk. The question for health-care providers looking to move to the cloud revolves around what the HIPAA standards are and what they need to do to meet them.</p>
<h3>Meeting HIPAA Standards in Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>To qualify as HIPAA compliant, a cloud storage system must meet government standards for data transmission and storage. HIPAA-compliant cloud systems use encryption products and firewalls to prevent devastating security breaches. Companies Googling “HIPAA-compliant cloud storage” are sure to find a number of providers that claim HIPAA certification. Such a certification simply does not exist. The government demands that all health-care providers store and transmit data and patient information in a way that is compliant with HIPAA standards but offers no certification for doing so.</p>
<p>In 2009, the HITECH Act passed in an effort to require all health-care providers to implement certain safeguards designed to protect all patient data and information. What does HIPAA require? Since its passage, healthcare providers and service center employees must sign a BAA to indicate that they understand and agree to adhere to all set standards of HIPAA when it comes to patient-data storage and transmission.</p>
<h3>What Are the HIPAA Standards for Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>To qualify as HIPAA-compliant cloud storage, all protected PHI (patient health information), including patient records, lab results and all imaging (MRIs, CAT scans, X-rays, etc.), must be stored and transmitted in ways that comply with government standards. These standards have two categories: physical safeguards and technical safeguards.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Physical safeguards required for HIPAA compliance. </strong>The physical safeguards refer to the protocols surrounding access and validation procedures for those trying to access the hardware that stores PHI. Essentially, they refer to regulations that control who is allowed to physically touch the servers that store protected information. Physical safeguards also include standards and regulations governing disaster-recovery plans for the data that could potentially be lost in a natural disaster. Lastly, physical safeguards also refer to HIPAA requirements that govern the use and disposal of EPHI (electronic private health information). An example would be protocol governing the disposal of failed hard drives.</li>
<li><strong>Technical safeguards required for HIPAA compliance.</strong> These safeguards regulate the electronic security of all protected information. Safeguard methods employed in this realm include encryption, decryption, authentication, user identification, audit and integrity controls. They also regulate the procedures for accessing EPHI during a natural disaster or emergency.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Finding a HIPAA-Compliant Cloud Storage Service</h3>
<p>Health-care enterprises looking to move their protected patient information to cloud storage must first investigate the HIPAA compliance of the cloud-storage service provider. To find a cloud service provider that is currently in compliance with HIPAA standards, contact your local data centers and ask for an overview of their HIPAA-compliance protocol. They should be able to quickly provide such information, and it will serve as a guidepost for choosing a cloud service provider.</p>
