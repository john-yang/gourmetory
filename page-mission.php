		<h2>Offer a special via social media.</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite ideas for local restaurants, is to offer a special of some kind for social media followers that takes place that same day, or even within an hour. It rewards followers by giving them insider invitations to something they find valuable, thereby building a stronger relationship (and encourages new followers so they’ll be in the know next time), and it gets customers through the door and sales made during a certain day/time that the business knows will otherwise be quiet.

My favorite was a contest we ran on social media, mixing it in with customers in the restaurant. We announced the contest on social media and also created cards to put in each checkbook to hand to customers when paying the bill. We asked the customers to take and post pictures with their favorite waitress or waitresses, including the specific hashtag. It was a lot of fun and we had a lot of photos to use for guest appreciation Friday’s on social media. We gave out gift cards, sponsored prizes, etc. and increased traffic through the contest and word of mouth.

				<h2>Get your customers to help.</h2>
<p>I work with a tearoom whose audience is mainly 55+. Magazine ads, word of mouth… they all bring in some clients. The best marketing idea we had was working with a local newspaper where they have a DealSaver section. We advertised the $25 high tea for buy-one-get-one. The newspaper estimated we would sell 40-50 of these coupons. We sold over 200 of them, meaning we served high tea to 400+ women!</p>

		<h2>Build buzz with the local media.</h2>
		<p>Facilitate a special evening just for VIP guests to experience your dishes, visit your space, and meet and interview the staff. Depending on the environment, a media night may mean communal dining, a classy cocktail hour, or huge party! Whatever the event, be sure to send your guests home with plenty of memories so they keep your client top-of-mind for future restaurant reviews, roundups, and other food-related features.</p>


<p>Then, the restaurant sends out weekly specials via text to their growing list of subscribers. This drive customers back to the restaurants to enjoy great deals on great food. Of course, customers can unsubscribe any time, but more often than not, they look forward to receiving the deals.</p>

<p>There are several SMS marketing services available, with different levels of investment. The learning curve isn’t that steep and the ROI is solid for biz owners who create a plan and execute it consistently.</p>

				<h2>Invite local influencers Over.</h2>
<p>Give out plastic (branded) spoons at festivals and events. Anyone who brings one into the restaurant gets their dessert free. Getting folks back to the restaurant from events is a huge challenge but fruitful opportunity.</p>

		<h2>Offer a deal in the local paper.</h2>
	<p>As they mention on their website, they are The Hampton’s First Seed-to-Table Restaurant which gives them the ability to combine ingredients from local farms and fisheries, along with their own grown-in-restaurant produce. In a world who is increasingly concerned about where their food comes from, this is a genius, well-timed marketing idea.</p>
<p>You can also post those reviews in your restaurant and on social media for a little proof that experts and critics love your place. Even if people have been eating there for ages, statistics show the psychological effect (confirmation bias) produces more money getting spent there.</p>
