			<h2>You Are A Good Business Owner. Why Isn’t Anyone Calling You?</h2>
			<p>Many small business owners – even ones who are tech-savvy – struggle to figure out a way to use the Internet to connect with potential clients. Becky struggled at first, too, but over time she developed a marketing strategy that combined her technical background and love of problem solving with a solid understanding of how to market her practice to the clients she wanted to attract. Her new strategy worked. Her practice exploded and she became financially successful very quickly. Now CounselingWise helps people like you create therapist websites that work.</p>
